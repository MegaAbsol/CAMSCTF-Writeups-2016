Opening the site, it says:
`"According to my chocolate chip cookie, you are not authorized." - C4pt4in Troll`.

So we look at the cookies, and see that there is a cookie that states:
`authorized=false`

We change the value of this cookie to true, and reload the page. We are then faced with a login screen, and it tells us the password is `i_1ikecookies`. We type this in to get the flag!
