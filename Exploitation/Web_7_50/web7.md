#Web 7 - 50
	I remember the good old times when all passwords were the same.

This time, there's both a username and a password field! When I see both of these, my first instinct is to try SQL injection. We try my generic SQL injection string (it works a lot):

`' OR 1 = 1 LIMIT 1 -- `

And it indeed works, bringing us to a new page that states,

`"The password is ( i_<3_sql_injections )" - C4pt4in Troll`. Typing this in, we get the flag!

Flag: `{vulner4bility_Exi3ts}`
