Web 5 - 50
	He is nice. He even gave you the password.

[Web 5](http://web.camsctf.com/5)

-------------

This time, he apparently gave us the password:
`PaSswOrD1@3$5^`
But when we try typing that in, it says Incorrect Password! Why?
We pull up Tamper Data (an extension for firefox), and see what's being posted behind the scenes:

It seems that no matter what we type, `password` is being passed as our password, instead of `PaSswOrD1@3$5^`. So we just manually change the request, and add 6 to the `Content-Length` header (because we added 6 characters). Submitting our tampered request, we get the flag... except we don't (At least I didn't). Because something went borkened and the server refuses to reply:

So instead we just use cURL. 

	curl 'http://web.camsctf.com/5/check.php' -H 'Pragma: no-cache' -H 'Origin: http://web.camsctf.com' -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate' -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8' -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/49.0.2623.110 Safari/537.36' -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryzoT3NWFy0mtq4nlv' -H 'Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01' -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' -H 'X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest' -H 'Connection: keep-alive' -H 'Referer: http://web.camsctf.com/5/' --data-binary $'------WebKitFormBoundaryzoT3NWFy0mtq4nlv\r\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name="answer"\r\n\r\nPaSswOrD1@3$5^\r\n------WebKitFormBoundaryzoT3NWFy0mtq4nlv--\r\n' --compressed

(You can get a string like this by going into chrome -> developer console -> network -> copy as cURL (bash) -> change "password" to "PaSswOrD1@3$5^")

Running this, we get the response:

`{"correct":1,"reply":"Flag: never_trust_what_a_tr0ll"}`

So our flag is `{never_trust_what_a_tr0ll}`.
