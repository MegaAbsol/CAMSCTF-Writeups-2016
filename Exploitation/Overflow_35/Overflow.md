	I won't let have the flag unless you can guess my password.

---------------------

We are given an ELF binary. So of course, the first thing we do is run `strings` on it:

```
$ strings 1
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
?V{[
libc.so.6
strcpy
exit
puts
printf
strcmp
__libc_start_main
__gmon_start__
GLIBC_2.2.5
UH- 
AWAVA
AUATL
[]A\A]A^A_
15kjagkhakganwgknangwajkg3iu5y1825618y5h1fknanfjwkh1481
Sorry, that's not right.
{0veRf1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000w
;*3$"
```
That second last thing looks like a flag, and sure enough, it is!

Flag: `{0veRf1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000w}`

Note: the real way to solve this was to pass the password `15kjagkhakganwgknangwajkg3iu5y1825618y5h1fknanfjwkh1481` as an argument to the executable.
