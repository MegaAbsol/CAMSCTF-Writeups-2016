	Good coding practices gone out the window.

[Web 4](http://web.camsctf.com/4/)

--------------------

This time, we look in the source code after reading the text, which tells us:

	Note: C4pt4in Troll is not particularly good at coding JavaScript. He did tell me that his password can be found using the function bar( 'barr' );, except his code doesn't actually work.

In the source, we see:

	var a = "b";
	var b = "a";
	function bar( barr ){
		return barr( barr ) + a + b + c + barr( barr );
	}

	function barr(){
		return "k";
	}
	var c = "r";

But since it doesn't work, we'll trace it by hand.

We call bar("barr"), so it returns:

	return barr("barr") + a + b + c + barr("barr")

But `barr("barr")` returns "k", so what we have now is:

	return "k" + a + b + c + "k"

Substituting in our values of a, b, and c, we get:

	return "k" + "b" + "a" + "r" + "k"

So we try `kbark` as our password, and we get our flag!
