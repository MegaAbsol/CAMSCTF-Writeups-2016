	Quite a lengthy way to do one thing.

[Web A](http://web.camsctf.com/10)

---------------

In the source code, we see a base64 encoded string that has been operated on:

`"It's encode, and gzencode, and encode, and gzdeflate, and encode, and gzcompress, and encode."`

We can write a quick php script to decode it for us.

```php
$s = "eJwFwdEOgiAUANAP8gEzGfbgwx20StBpsLZ8pa4jI2O2TL6+c4oI791L7wEzWL1BGBMyzy6MfMGpCKuEFlMeH/J5F85z475qIKJCVkx1pJ3bEtldfU1Y6pQN1jGqoYdG5Zkh+mP18JPiFBpYc1Fz3io83I5qk7SsWpYLFWeAsvwDZNoqeQ==";
echo base64_decode(gzdecode(base64_decode(gzinflate(base64_decode(gzuncompress(base64_decode($s)))))));
```

This prints out:

`$password = "gzip_bzip_7zip_zip"; echo $password;`

We enter the password and get a flag.

Flag: {zip_z_internet}
