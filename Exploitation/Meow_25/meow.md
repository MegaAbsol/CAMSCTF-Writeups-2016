Meow - 25
	My friend's foster kittens accidentally encrypted my Scratch project. :(

---------------------

We open the website, and see that its a broken scratch project. The source of the iframe is https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/embed/BCGAIDBB/?autostart=false, but that's a dead link too. But looking around at other scratch projects, like https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/26216673/, show us that the url should have numbers (like `26216673`), not letters (like `BCGAIDBB`). We convert the letters to their respective place in the alphabet, so B -> 2 and C -> 3, etc. and get:

`23719422`

And https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/23719422/ is indeed not a dead link. Clicking "See inside" to see the source code, we look at `Sprite2`:

So our flag is `{scr4tch_c4t}`.
