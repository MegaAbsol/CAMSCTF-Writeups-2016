#Web 8 - 100

	We didn't think C4pt4in Troll could get any better at coding. He did.

[Web 8](http://web.camsctf.com/8)
----------------

Note: We did not solve this during the competition, but then after it ended I realized it was really easy.

This time, when we open the website's source code we are faced with some heavily obfuscated code. We don't have to deobfuscate it, though, since in the comment it says:

`// We are looking for the 'code.' ;) - Lujing`

Well, we can get a list of variables that exist in console with:

```javascript
for(var b in window) { 
  if(window.hasOwnProperty(b)) console.log(b); 
}
```

And our output:

Wow! Variables c, o, d, and e all exist! So we can just type into console:


	> c+o+d+e
	"1344431131239864"

Which is the "code." We type that in as our password, and get a flag!
