# Reversing 1 - 30

    Each exe contains a flag. Find it. Sound easy? We can assure you it isn't.
    A reminder that all flags are submitted in the {flag} format.
[1.exe](1.exe)

------------------

This is the first reversing problem. As with all binaries, the first thing we can try is

```$ strings 1.exe```

And we can see the flag.

Flag: ```{not_encrypted_string_flag_whoooo}```
