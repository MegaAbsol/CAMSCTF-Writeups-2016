#Steggy - 25

	Oh no! Something wrong happenned to the source text of the Stegosaurus article on Wikipedia!
	Hint: wbStego4

[steggy.txt](steggy.txt)

---------
From the hint, we download wbstego (http://wbstego.wbailer.com/) (I used wbStego4open). We give it our steggy.txt as source file, and since we weren't given a password we leave that blank. In our output file, we find the flag!


Flag: `{t3Xt_with1n_text}`
