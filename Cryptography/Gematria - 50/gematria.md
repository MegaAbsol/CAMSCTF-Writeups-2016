# Gematria - 50
	I heard that you can associate words with numbers. What about flags?

------------------

In this problem, we are given a number: 

`46327402297733105104468896449452312521697635735182434903808055110726686224509`

Since base 10 isn't the best base to work with in computing, we convert it to hex:

`666c61677b315f6233745f22793075225f623363306d33735f615f7a3372307d`

But that looks like the hex values of ascii characters! We try converting it to ascii, and get the flag.

`flag{1_b3t_"y0u"_b3c0m3s_a_z3r0}`
